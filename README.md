# Todo-List

This is simple Todo-list application using Spring Boot. It uses in-memory database H2 which will store the list. It also uses Spring security. 
To access type username = "user" password="user".

## There is just one user right now. So you can add dyanamically new users. This is very raw application. Need much of the work.
